The baseline determinants of sovereign bond yield spreads in the Euro area are the bid-ask spread, the VIX, fiscal developments and rating developments, REER, and economic growth. QE measures implemented by the ECB in the aftermath of the crisis are also relevant. From the TVC analysis, the Covered Bond Purchase Programme contributed to reduce yield spreads, particularly in the 2011–2013 period. Longer-term refinancing operations contributed to reduce yield spreads in most countries.}}

The model indicates that higher oil returns tends to reduce the long-term risk of the Saudi market, but to increase it in other markets. The risk transfer from oil to MENA equities is found to be weak. The dynamic conditional correlation between oil and equities is not always positive and it unexpectedly changes sign during the sample period. However, the association always strengthens when there is a large draw down in oil prices as well as during periods of high volatility. Finally, we find that short term association occasionally breaks from the longer-term correlation particularly in Egypt and Turkey. These patterns of influence and associations are unique, and have important implications for equity portfolio managers who are interested in investing in energy and MENA equities.}}

In this model, banks lend and borrow in the interbank market to mitigate liquidity risk and trade derivatives contracts in the OTC derivatives market to mitigate market risk. The daily mark-to-market of derivatives contracts results in daily margin calls that banks cover using high quality liquid assets. We find that distress due to margin procyclicality in the derivatives market can spillover to the interbank market leading to systemic liquidity risk. Interconnectedness further amplifies the effects of systemic risk within the interbank market. The model shows that central clearing might increase the possibility of systemic liquidity risk due to tight margin requirements and the timing of cash flows required from banks. We also find that haircut levels affect the possibility of systemic liquidity risk, and highlight the potential role of a market maker of last resort in limiting this possibility.}}

PCM significantly explains cross-sectional returns while controlling for other factors. This effect is robust to alternative specifications and remains significant after the decimalization in 2001. In sum, PCM is easy to implement and serves as an effective proxy for informed trading.}}

Using the GMM technique, our estimates indicate that credit risk is positively related to loan sizes among microfinance institutions operating in SSA. Our findings have significant implications for the portfolio managers of microfinance institutions operating in SSA, particularly in light of the current wave of mobile money services in many countries.}}

The estimated break dates for the persistence appear to correspond to major economic events caused by macroeconomic shocks or changes in monetary policy. We provide some implications for the forward premium anomaly: if the forward premium is strictly stationary and has long memory, in which the confidence interval includes only the stationary region, the anomaly appears to be resolved or uncovered interest rate parity tends to hold. This finding suggests that the degree of the persistence of the forward premium plays an important role in explaining the anomaly.}}

The analysis uses an endogenous regime switching model with an autoregressive latent factor, in which the future transition between states depends on the current state as well as the realization of the underlying time series. The results show that carry trades are profitable in a regime with low exchange rate volatility, signifying the failure of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP). However, carry trades yield losses in a regime with high exchange rate volatility, which implies a reversion to UIP. The endogenous latent factor obtained from the model represents historical economic downturns associated with carry trade losses well. It also appears to exhibit a similar pattern to those of two measures of uncertainty, macroeconomic uncertainty and economic policy uncertainty.}}

Also, we explore whether China’s new relationship with Africa has somehow altered the preexisting relationship between Africa and its traditional partners. Our results, using the fixed-effects and instrumental variable approaches to 36 countries over the period 2003–2012, indicate that Chinese FDI improves income in Africa. We also find that the impact is more pronounced for U.S. and German investment. Moreover, there is evidence that Chinese investment crowds out U.S. investment in Africa, whereas France seems to be competing with China. These results imply that as the Chinese economy grows, the demand for resources has increased its intensive competition with the U.S. rather than with France.}}

Results from the univariate analysis show that there exists a high degree of persistence with orders of integration about 1 or higher than 1, implying that shocks to these stock markets have significant permanent effects. Concerning bivariate results and testing for cointegration, evidence of cointegration is found for Egypt and Kenya against the UK and the Europe Zone. There are some other cases where partial evidence of cointegration is found, though in general, in all cases, we observe that the degree of cointegration is very low, implying very long periods of convergence.}}

The results show that: i) credit information sharing reduces financial fragility for both groups of countries; ii) for less developed countries, the main effect is the direct effect (reduction of NPL ratio once credit boom is controlled), suggesting a portfolio quality effect; iii) credit information sharing also mitigates the detrimental impact of a credit boom on financial fragility but this result holds only for advanced and emerging countries and for household credit booms; and iv) the depth of information sharing has a negative impact on the likelihood of credit booms (but not the coverage of IS).}}

We find that issuers with unrated and bank-guaranteed bonds have more information asymmetry and possess poorer firm quality. Japanese banks provide credit guarantees to the bonds issued by small or opaque firms with weaker financial profiles, thus reducing the risk of issuer default, as well as saving on bond rating fees and the costs of a public offering. The bank guarantee for private and unrated bonds serves as valuable (but costly) protection for investors who invest in these riskier issuers’ bonds. Most importantly, after the U.S. financial crisis, the impact of bank guarantees on yield spreads becomes much less significant as bond issuers have begun to rely more on credit ratings as a potentially cheaper and more effective monitoring/corporate governance mechanism.}}

Estimation results from the quantile regression framework used herein show that heterogeneity in the explanatory power of the factors across low credit risk periods and high credit risk periods, such as during the 2008–09 financial crisis and 2011–13 European debt crisis, are a likely reason why extant time series regression models of CDS spreads yield instability in coefficient estimates and varying degrees of statistical significance across sample periods and time.}}

We examine a sample of 29,000 classic car auction sales conducted globally between 1998 and 2017. A hedonic pricing methodology is used to construct several classic car price indices, which enable a risk-return analysis. Classic cars appreciated annually by 3.37% and 5.63%, respectively in real and in nominal terms before transaction costs. Investments in ‘blue chip’ classic cars (12.50%) and Italian classics (11.28%) generate the highest annual nominal returns. On a risk-adjusted basis, classic cars have outperformed equity and other emotional assets such as art, but underperformed bonds and gold over the past two decades. The risk-adjusted returns on the category of affordable classics are similar to those of equity investments.}}

We further show that the ambiguity premium remains significant after controlling for exposures to expected real GDP growth, VIX, and financial market dislocations index.}}

The creation of a domestic and non-mandatory premium listing in 2000 offers a unique opportunity to analyse the relation of its adoption on cash holdings. For this purpose, we used a sample of Brazilian companies between 2001 and 2014. The results indicate, after controlling for endogeneity through the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) by dynamic panel data, that only firms listed in the New Market (NM), where companies can only issue shares with voting rights, obtained positive significance. Therefore, the issuance of only voting shares reduces agency costs and managerial entrenchment, and consequently reduces the expropriation of the cash holdings, given its vulnerability. In this way, the results obtained in this study contribute to the literature, especially for emerging markets where the use of non-voting shares is common, by pointing out that investors can have greater confidence on cash holdings management in companies where only voting shares are allowed.}}

We find longer debt maturities, higher leverage, and, in a dynamic setting, a greater propensity to decrease short-term debt, in countries with high investor protection and where the potentials for debt tax shields and after-tax return of investors are high. Our results imply that when investors are protected, firms tend to have optimal debt maturities to maximise the gains from tax shields and minimise the tax cost of equity. In contrast, in low protection countries, investors prefer their firms to opt for low debt that is mainly short-term to mitigate the risk-shifting and debt overhang problems even if this entails forgoing the debt tax shields. Our results hold for various robustness checks including the hierarchical linear model specification, which corrects for a number of OLS biases.}}

This study aims to present the results of a penetration test involving smart locks in the context of building security. The authors investigated how the amount of effort an employee has to invest in complying with a security policy (i.e. walk from the office to the smart key activator) influences vulnerability. In particular, the attractiveness of a no-effort alternative (i.e. someone else walking from your office to the key activators to perform a task on your behalf) was evaluated. The contribution of this study relates to showing how experimental psychology can be used to determine the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of physical building security measures. Design/methodology/approach Twenty-seven different “offenders” visited the offices of 116 employees. Using a script, each offender introduced a problem, provided a solution and asked the employee to hand over their office key. Findings A total of 58.6 per cent of the employees handed over their keys to a stranger; no difference was found between female and male employees. The likelihood of handing over the keys for employees close to a key activator was similar to that of those who were further away. Research limitations/implications The results suggest that installing additional key activators is not conducive to reducing the building’s security vulnerability associated with the handing over of keys to strangers. Originality/value No research seems to have investigated the distribution of smart key activators in the context of a physical penetration test. This research highlights the need to raise awareness of social engineering and of the vulnerabilities introduced via smart locks (and other smart systems).}}

To accommodate the empirical behavior of the cross-section of returns and of the factors, we allow both the factors and the error functions can exhibit mild departures from stationarity. This requires new asymptotic theory which leads to several tests for the significance of function-valued regression coefficients. The new approach to the study of the significance of risk factors for a cross-section of returns complements the established Fama–French approach based on portfolio construction. It is more suitable if the statistical significance of the risk factors is to be rigorously controlled.}}

title = {Practical Bayesian support vector regression for financial time series prediction and market condition change detection},
keywords = {NA},
abstract = {Support vector regression (SVR) has long been proven to be a successful tool to predict financial time series. The core idea of this study is to outline an automated framework for achieving a faster and easier parameter selection process, and at the same time, generating useful prediction uncertainty estimates in order to effectively tackle flexible real-world financial time series prediction problems. A Bayesian approach to SVR is discussed, and implemented. It is found that the direct implementation of the probabilistic framework of Gao et al. returns unsatisfactory results in our experiments. A novel enhancement is proposed by adding a new kernel scaling parameter to overcome the difficulties encountered. In addition, the multi-armed bandit Bayesian optimization technique is applied to automate the parameter selection process. Our framework is then tested on financial time series of various asset classes (i.e. equity index, credit default swaps spread, bond yields, and commodity futures) to ensure its flexibility. It is shown that the generalization performance of this parameter selection process can reach or sometimes surpass the computationally expensive cross-validation procedure. An adaptive calibration process is also described to allow practical use of the prediction uncertainty estimates to assess the quality of predictions. It is shown that the machine-learning approach discussed in this study can be developed as a very useful pricing tool, and potentially a market condition change detector. A further extension is possible by taking the prediction uncertainties into consideration when building a financial portfolio.}}

keywords = {NA},
abstract = {This article considers whether survey respondents' views regarding the likelihood of stock index returns exceeding specific thresholds are comparable to market views indicated by index options with strikes at analogous thresholds. It is motivated by the observation that the wording used to elicit subjective beliefs in surveys about expected future returns resembles the question a purchaser of a call option might ask. Building on this association, the authors document a similarity between the views of survey respondents and those of financial market participants as measured through call options, although the association is not 1-for-1. They find a closer association for those demonstrating a better understanding of the laws of probability, suggesting that numeracy affects the accuracy of an elicited response.}}

title = {Trading Behavior and Monetary Policy News},
keywords = {NA},
abstract = {The author examines the patterns of trading behavior in the period surrounding monetary policy announcements. Utilizing a high-frequency dataset, with broker identifiers enabling classification of trades executed through institutional and retail brokers, the author investigates all trades submitted on the Australian Securities Exchange over the period of December 2007 to December 2014. The author identifies a rapid, asymmetric, price adjustment to the announcement, which is larger when the target rate decision results in lower-than-expected rates, and is accompanied by a sharp increase in market activity. Institutional brokers tend to execute trades more quickly following the announcement, and target more liquid large-cap stocks. Trades executed through institutional brokers appear to be more profitable, although profits are concentrated in buy trades. The evidence supports the notion that institutional investors have an advantage in processing the news resulting from target rate decisions.}}

keywords = {NA},
abstract = { This paper explores whether affine models with volatility jumps estimated on intradaily S\&P 500 futures data over 1983 to 2008 can capture major daily outliers such as the 1987 stock market crash. Intradaily jumps in futures prices are typically small; self-exciting but short-lived volatility spikes capture intradaily and daily returns better. Multifactor models of the evolution of diffusive variance and jump intensities improve fits substantially, including out-of-sample over 2009 to 2016. The models capture reasonably well the conditional distributions of daily returns and realized variance outliers, but underpredict realized variance inliers. I also examine option pricing implications.}}

keywords = {NA},
abstract = { We examine the herding behavior of investors in the US financial industry, especially commercial banks, S\&Ls, investment and insurance firms during global financial crisis of 2008 towards own sub-sector and market consensus using augmented cross sectional absolute deviation of returns (CSAD) model. After distinguishing between fundamental and non-fundamental information, we find a greater influence of global financial crisis on spurious herding for commercial and investment banks, and such herding increases in the down market and with conditional volatility of returns, but adverse herding is prevalent among investors during normal period in response to fundamental information. We also find that herding intensity on fundamental information is relatively high with market consensus for all financial institutions except insurance firms in high volatility regime, and intentional herding is only significant and limited to S\&Ls and investment banks in high volatility regime. Our findings suggest limited spillover effects of herding when investors face non-fundamental information.}}

abstract = { Deteriorating economic conditions in late 2008 led the Federal Reserve to lower the target federal funds rate to near zero, inject liquidity through novel facilities, and engage in large-scale asset purchases. The combination of conventional and unconventional policy measures prevents using the effective federal funds rate to assess the effects of monetary policy beyond 2008. We employ a broad monetary aggregate to elicit the effects of monetary policy shocks both before and after 2008. Our estimates align well with major changes in the Fed's asset purchase programs and yield responses that are free from price, output, and liquidity puzzles that plague other approaches.}}
