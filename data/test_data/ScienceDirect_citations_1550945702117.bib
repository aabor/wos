abstract = "We examine whether ambiguity is priced in the cross-section of expected stock returns. Using the cross-sectional dispersion in real-time forecasts of real GDP growth as a measure for ambiguity, we find that high ambiguity beta stocks earn lower future returns relative to low ambiguity beta stocks. This negative predictive relation between the ambiguity beta and future returns is consistent with theory, which predicts the marginal utility of consumption to rise when ambiguity is high. We further show that the ambiguity premium remains significant after controlling for exposures to expected real GDP growth, VIX, and financial market dislocations index."

abstract = "This paper solves the dynamic portfolio allocation problem with account of time-varying jump risk. We find that both the initial jump intensity as a state variable and the jump dynamics including the average jump intensity and jump persistence are important for the investorâ€™s optimal portfolio decision. The risk-averse investor can benefit from the optimal dynamic strategy instead of the myopic strategy. The out-of-sample results show that compared with the no-jump model, constant-jump model or the equal weighted portfolio, the dynamic portfolio with account of time-varying jump risk can produce better performance, and is more preferred by the risk-averse investor."
